  <h2>Work History:</h2>
  <h3>Robotics Software Engineer - Japan</h3>

  <p>
    Currently I am working at <a href="https://www.seqsense.com/">SEQSENSE</a> / シークセンス writing software for our SQ2 and Forro robots.
    SQ2 is an autonomous security robot that carries out scheduled, pre-defined patrols each day in large office buildings.
    Forro is a delivery robot developed as part of a joint venture with Kawasaki Heavy Industries.

  <p>
    Both models of robot utilise a custom design of rotating turntable with three 2D LiDARs for environmental perception and navigation.
    Additionally, the robots have wide-angle cameras placed around its structure to achieve a 360-degree field of view.
    Robots feeds real-time data to a web-based platform, enabling security personnel to monitor patrols or jobs and view the robot's activities at any moment.
    The robot is capable of self-docking for battery recharging and is equipped to use designated elevators, facilitating multi-level patrol operations.

      My work focuses on a 3D object detection and tracking system and our in-house SLAM-based mapping solution.
      The following shows a prototype interface for our SLAM system that I developed to run on the robot.
      It allowed users to run SLAM in real-time and view the map as it is being built, with scan quality estimation shown in green.
      The interface was designed to be displayed on a tablet or smartphone that was mounted to a Playstation controller, hence the circle and cross logos on the buttons.
      Unfortunately, the system didn't make it onto our production robots.

  <h3>Robotics Post-Doctoral Researcher - New Zealand</h3>

  <p>
    As a post-doctoral researcher for the <a href="https://www.waikato.ac.nz/">University of Waikato</a> and <a href="https://www.auckland.ac.nz/">The University of Auckland</a>, I contributed to the development of a robotic system for the kiwifruit industry.
    This project was a collaboration between the universities, Plant and Food Research, and Robotics Plus Ltd and was funded by the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment.
    As a team of about 12 people, we developed robotics for autonomously pollinating and harvesting kiwifruit as well as a multi-purpose platform to which we could attach the pollinating and harvesting robots.

  <p>
    My area was the development of our multi-purpose platform, a mobile base for the kiwifruit harvesting and pollinating modules.
    The platform was a hybrid petrol-electric vehicle capable of autonomous row-following in kiwifruit orchards by way of lidar based sensing of the orchard's structure.
    It could drive fully electrically by way of six electric motor/gearbox units while providing AC and DC power outputs any mounted robotic systems.
    Also, it had a carrying capacity of 1 tonne on its payload space, plus extra capacity to carry kiwifruit in the space between the rear wheels.

  </figure>
  <p>
    The kiwifruit harvester could identify kiwifruit in 3D using stereo cameras and artificial neural network, decide in which order to harvest the kiwifruit (to minimise damage to neighboring fruit), then instruct the custom robotic harvesting arms to take the fruit.
    The system used stereo vision, neural networks, and robotic arms to pick kiwifruit from the vines.
    See the video for a demonstration of the system in action.

    <figcaption>The pollinator spraying a targeted cluster of kiwifruit flowers</figcaption>
  </figure>
  <p>
    The pollinator could use the same cameras and neural-networks to identify flowers in 3D and then shoot pollen solution at flowers as the vehicle drove underneath.
    The time-of-flight of the pollen solution was calculated for each shot so the pollen would hit the flower while the vehicle was in motion.
    This animation shows the general process.

  <p>
    This was an incredible project to be a part of, and I am really proud of the work we did.
    I learned a lot about robotics, machine learning, and the kiwifruit industry.
    I also learned a lot about working in a large team and the importance of good communication and documentation.
