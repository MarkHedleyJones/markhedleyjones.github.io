description: "- a comprehensive guide to profiling C++ applications with Tracy"
---

[Tracy Profiler](https://github.com/wolfpld/tracy) is a real-time profiler for C++ applications that I've been using in my recent projects. Unlike traditional sampling profilers, Tracy provides exact timing data with minimal overhead.

This guide shows how to integrate Tracy with an existing CMake project and capture your first profile. The instructions assume Ubuntu 22.04, though the process is similar on other platforms.

Tracy consists of two components: client-side macros that you embed in your code, and a viewer application that receives and displays the profiling data in real-time.

## Project Integration

First, clone the Tracy repository into your project directory:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/wolfpld/tracy
```

Next, update your project's CMakeLists.txt to include Tracy:
```cmake
include_directories(
  include
  tracy/public
  ...
)

option( TRACY_ENABLE "" ON)
add_subdirectory(tracy)

add_executable(<your_project>
  tracy/public/TracyClient.cpp
  ...
)

target_link_libraries(<your_project>
  Tracy::TracyClient
  ...
)
```

Now compile your project in debug mode:
```bash
mkdir build && cd build
cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=DEBUG ..
make
```

### Building the Tracy Viewer
The Tracy viewer compiles from source to ensure compatibility with your client version. First, install the required dependencies:

```bash
sudo apt install libglfw3-dev libfreetype-dev libcapstone-dev libdbus-1-dev
```

Then build the viewer. For X11 systems:
```bash
cd tracy/profiler/build/unix
make LEGACY=1
```

For Wayland systems:
```bash
cd tracy/profiler/build/unix
make
```

This creates a binary called `Tracy-release` in the build directory. Launch it with:
```bash
./Tracy-release
```

The Tracy viewer interface will appear:

### Running Your Application
With the Tracy viewer running, you can now profile your application. Running with sudo allows Tracy to access system performance counters for more detailed profiling:

```bash
cd build
sudo ./<your_project_executable>
```

Once your application starts, Tracy will display real-time profiling data:
