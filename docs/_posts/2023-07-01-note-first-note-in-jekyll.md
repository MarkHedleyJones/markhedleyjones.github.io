Jekyll can generate a static website from posts contained in the `_posts` folder.
This is good for example if you want to display a portfolio of projects (as I do on this website). However, if you also want to be able to have a separate list of things, like notes, how do you do that?

## Categorising your posts

Because I use a different layout for my pages between notes and projects, it was convenient to separate my posts using the `layout` field. For example, this post has the header

## Filtering your posts

In the page where you list all the posts you can change your assignment statement from

```
assign posts = site.posts
```
to 
```
assign notes = site.posts | where: "layout","note"
```
and 
```
assign projects = site.posts | where: "layout","project"
```
