<p>
  PHP-HTMLifier generates HTML code using PHP.
  This means no more <code>echo</code> statements or entering and exiting the PHP environment inside an HTML document.
  And the best part is - you can't forget to close a div because the library takes care of element generation for you.
  Your PHP code will be more manageable, reusable and error free.
</p>
<p>
  Consider the following example PHP file (from the PHP website):
</p>
{% highlight php %}
<html>
  <head>
    <title>PHP Test</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <p><?php echo 'Hello World'; ?></p>
  </body>
</html>
{% endhighlight %}
<p>
Now we make the same page with PHP-HTMLifier...
</p>
{% highlight php %}
<?php
$page = new Page('PHP Test');
$page->p('Hello World');
{% endhighlight %}
<p>
  That's all there is to it.
</p>
<p>
  If you've spent much time with PHP you know how quickly things can get out of hand. That's where this PHP-HTMLifier excels - you don't have to keep track of opening and closing divs and other tags.
