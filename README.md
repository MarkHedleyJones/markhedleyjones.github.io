# Development

This repository uses [docker-bbq](https://www.github.com/markhedleyjones/docker-bbq) for rapid development.
Steps in this document assume you have this installed.

Build the image with `make`.
Once built, run the development server using: `run server`

You can then modify the contents of <docs> and it should be updated live.
